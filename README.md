# openwebui-n8n-app


This repository provides a quick setup for running **[OpenWebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)** inside Docker and connecting it with a **custom n8n workflow** via a webhook.  
It enables you to build AI-powered workflows, where OpenWebUI acts as the LLM interface and **n8n** handles automation, API calls, and orchestration.
